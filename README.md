üìò Project Overview

The Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to analyze patient demographics, hospital performance, and treatment outcomes. This dashboard provides an interactive and visual representation of healthcare data, enabling stakeholders to monitor patient trends, assess hospital efficiency, and improve overall medical service quality. It focuses on understanding key metrics such as patient count, average treatment cost, admission rates, recovery statistics, and departmental performance.

üéØ Objectives

To visualize patient distribution across age groups, gender, and hospital departments.

To analyze hospital performance through treatment success rates and patient satisfaction levels.

To monitor total admissions, average treatment cost, and length of hospital stays.

To identify key factors influencing patient outcomes and cost variations.

To provide an interactive dashboard for healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions.

üìä Key Insights & Visuals

Total Patients & Admissions:

The dataset covers over 10K patients from multiple hospital branches.

Provides insights into inpatient vs. outpatient statistics.

Demographic Analysis:

Gender Distribution: Nearly equal male and female representation, with females slightly higher in outpatient visits.

Age Group Distribution: Majority of patients fall in the 31‚Äì50 years range, indicating the most active healthcare demographic.

Average Age: Around 42 years across all hospital branches.

Departmental Performance:

Departments include Cardiology, Orthopedics, General Medicine, Pediatrics, and Neurology.

Cardiology and Orthopedics record the highest number of admissions and total revenue.

Average Recovery Rate: Over 88%, showing consistent healthcare quality across departments.

Financial Insights:

Total Revenue: Generated over $12.5M across all departments.

Average Treatment Cost: $1,250 per patient, with Cardiology showing the highest cost.

Cost vs. Recovery Rate Visualization: Helps correlate expenditure with patient outcomes.

Hospital Branch Comparison:

Compares performance across multiple hospital locations.

Identifies top-performing branches based on recovery rate, cost efficiency, and patient satisfaction.

Filters & Interactivity:

Slicers for Gender, Age Group, Department, and Admission Type.

Date range filter allows analysis of specific time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Dynamic visuals update in real-time based on user selections.

üß† Insights Derived

Middle-aged adults (31‚Äì50 years) are the most frequent hospital visitors.

Cardiology contributes the highest revenue and treatment costs but also shows strong recovery rates.

General Medicine handles the largest number of patients, ensuring essential healthcare access.

Hospitals with shorter average stays often have better patient satisfaction.

Interactive data exploration enables hospitals to identify inefficiencies and optimize resources.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used

Tool: Microsoft Power BI

Data Source: Healthcare Patient Dataset (CSV/Excel format)

Custom Theme, Gradient Background, and KPI Cards for professional visual design

üìà Conclusion

The Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of patient demographics, financial metrics, and hospital performance. It empowers healthcare administrators and policymakers to make informed, data-driven decisions for improving patient care, optimizing departmental operations, and reducing treatment costs. By offering clear visual insights and dynamic interactivity, this dashboard serves as a valuable analytical tool for the healthcare industry.
